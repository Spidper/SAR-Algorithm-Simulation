# SAR-Range-Doppler-Algorithm-Simulation
A MATLAB Script capable of simulating SAR signal from multiple targets and generating image.

RDA.m: a detailed implementation of range doppler algorithm

SAR_sim.m: contain a fast implementaion of range doppler algorithm, chirp scaling algorithm and a questionable implementation of omega-k algorithm
